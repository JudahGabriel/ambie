            "description": "Ambie is an app that plays white noise and nature sounds to help you focus, sleep, and unwind. For many people, having background noise while working on a task helps with concentration. Ambie has a good starting selection of built-in sounds such as rain and beach waves that help you. These can also be used to help you sleep, relax, and de-stress. For instance, those with tinnitus and anxiety have reached out saying Ambie has helped them. And if you download Ambie from the Microsoft Store, you'll get access to a catalogue of online sounds that you can download to expand your library.",
